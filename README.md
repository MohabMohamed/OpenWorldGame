# 7enkesh

This is an open world 3D game about a boy called 7enkesh (Henkesh). <br />
His father is a microbus driver and his mother takes care of home. <br />
He's a very naughty and silly boy, he likes to tease people around him. He used to work for his father on the microbus; collecting money from the passengers, but he kept taking the money for himself and bothering all the passengers. His father kicked him out. <br />

Now 7enkesh will follow his dream of becoming a mighty independent toktok driver. <br />
Everytime he bothers people or tease them he gets money as a reward, he also does some street missions (but it's not gonna be serious or illegal stuff like GTA, instead it's gonna be funny). <br />
His goal is to collect 15,000 pounds to buy his own toktok. <br />

## Technology Stack

* JmonkeyEngine SDK (for game programming).
* Blender3D (for 3D art).

## Current State

I'm not even sure if that's the best code foundation laid right there, but I've had good layers of abstractions that should cover all the needs to come. <br />
I'll upload a class diagram soon so that you'd have better understanding of the code. <br />

As for the artwork, it certainly sucks. I need 3D artists and animators. help!

## How to run the game

1. Download [JmonkeyEngine SDK](http://jmonkeyengine.org/downloads/)
2. Install it.
3. Install git if you don't have it already.
4. Clone this project or download it. `git clone https://github.com/lordadamson/7enkesh.git`
5. Open that project using JmonkeyEngine SDK.
6. Build and run.
